Zabatni — Claude Code README
Project Overview
Zabatni is a single-page matchmaking website targeting Cairo's A+ demographic. The core concept is a live population visualization that responds to user filters — users watch a crowd narrow down to their compatible matches before submitting their own profile.
Visual Reference
The attached screenshot ("The Curator") captures the exact layout direction. Use it as the primary design reference with the following adaptations:

Single page, no subpages, no navigation links
Remove all "invitation only" / "apply for membership" language
Brand name is Zabatni — replace "The Curator" throughout
Keep the split-panel layout: visualization left, content right
Keep the bottom status bar showing active pool count
Keep the coordinates footer detail (Cairo: 30.0444° N, 31.2357° E)

The Visualization Panel (Left)
This is the most important element. It is a dense grid of small dot/circle figures representing the eligible population of Greater Cairo and Giza (~20 million combined). As filters are applied, dots grey out, leaving only the matching colored dots visible. Key behaviors:

All dots start active (warm accent color)
Greyed dots remain visible to preserve sense of total pool size
The transition should animate smoothly when filters change
The active pool counter at the bottom updates in real time
Dots should be small and dense enough to feel like a data visualization, not decorative

The Filter Panel (Right)
Replaces the static copy from the reference. Contains:

A short headline and one-line descriptor
The 7 filter controls (Gender, Age, Religion, Religiosity, Marital Status, Education, Neighborhood)
A primary CTA button: "Find My Match"
A secondary line: "Submit your profile to get matched"

Filters & Population Logic
Each filter reduces the active pool count. Base pool is the eligible Greater Cairo and Giza population. The primary target neighborhoods are Tagamoa (New Cairo) and Sheikh Zayed — these should appear as default or top-listed options in the neighborhood filter. Approximate weight of each filter is documented in zabatni_filter_data.md — use those percentages to calculate the pool reduction logic.
Tech Stack

Plain HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript — no frameworks, no build tools
Single .html file
The dot grid should be rendered on a <canvas> element for performance

Tone & Design

Premium, warm, minimal — not a dating app, a matchmaking platform
Color palette: off-white/cream background on the right panel, muted teal/sage grid background on the left (per reference), warm gold or amber as the accent for active dots
Typography: serif display font for headlines, clean sans for UI elements
No hearts, no pink, nothing that reads as casual or playful
